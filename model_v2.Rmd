## Load Packages
```{r cars}
library(dplyr)   
library(readr)  
library(ggplot2)
# library(statsr)
library(gridExtra)
library(corrplot)
library(tidyr)
```

## Dataset 
```{r}
movieset <- read.csv("output.csv")
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
